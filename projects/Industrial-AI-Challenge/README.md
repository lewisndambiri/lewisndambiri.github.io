## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Fedrigoni Industrial AI Challenge** where we focused on improving the slitting process in paper manufacturing at **Fedrigoni’s Arco plant**. By leveraging **predictive AI models** and **data analytics**, we aimed to predict daily slitting output and optimize production management to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The goal of this project was to help Fedrigoni move from **reactive to predictive production management**, allowing them to anticipate low-output scenarios and make proactive adjustments to production workloads.

## Objectives

- Analyze and identify key drivers of variability in the slitting process, such as machine performance, order profiles, and product mix.
- Develop predictive models to forecast daily slitting capacity based on various inputs.
- Improve operational efficiency by anticipating low-output scenarios and redistributing workloads to prevent delays and downtime.

## Methodology

We followed the **CRISP-DM methodology**, which helped guide our data preparation, modeling, and evaluation processes:

1. **Business Understanding**: Defined the key operational problems in the slitting process.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collected and analyzed production data, including machine performance, order intake, and monthly production forecasts.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and integrated various data sources to make them suitable for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Applied a range of **ensemble forecasting models** to predict daily slitting capacity.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed the models using performance metrics to determine the most reliable solution.
6. **Deployment**: Discussed potential real-world deployment and integration within Fedrigoni's production system.

## Key Results

- Achieved a **95% accuracy rate** in forecasting daily slitting output based on historical production data.
- Developed a predictive tool capable of simulating up to **3 days** of production output, allowing the operations team to take proactive measures.
- Successfully maintained **slitter utilization around 85%**, improving production efficiency and lead times.
- Enabled the shift from **reactive to proactive production management**, helping to balance workloads and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Modeling & Forecasting**: Ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## Next Steps & Future Work

- **Real-time Data Integration**: The next step involves integrating real-time machine performance data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Future work will focus on deploying the model into a live production environment.
- **Scalability**: The model could be extended to other production lines within Fedrigoni, improving overall manufacturing operations.

## Contributions

This project was completed by **Team 3** for the **Fedrigoni Industrial AI Challenge**. Contributions included data analysis, model development, feature engineering, and evaluation.

Special thanks to **Fedrigoni's Arco plant** for their collaboration and support in providing insights into the production environment.

## Notes

- **Confidentiality**: Certain technical details, such as specific machine learning models, parameters, and proprietary data, have been omitted for confidentiality purposes.
- **Data**: All data used in this project is proprietary and provided by **Fedrigoni** for the purpose of this challenge.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of **AI and data analytics** to optimize industrial processes. By predicting slitting capacity and automating production management decisions, we can help companies like **Fedrigoni** increase operational efficiency and better serve their customers.
