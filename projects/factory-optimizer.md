# Smart Factory Workflow Optimizer

## 🎯 Problem
A simulated semiconductor production line suffered from 30% idle time due to unbalanced workstations.

## 🔧 Approach
- Modeled system using **SimPy** (Python discrete-event simulation)
- Applied **queuing theory** and **bottleneck analysis**
- Tested dynamic scheduling rules vs. static assignment

## 📈 Result
- **22% reduction** in average cycle time
- Workstation utilization balanced to >85%
- Recommendations implemented in class capstone

## 🛠️ Tools
Python, SimPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
