## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. Maintenance Mode Prediction
*Statistics & Data Analysis | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas*  
![Maintenance Mode Predictor preview](projects/maintenance-mode-predictor/preview.jpg){: .project-preview }
Built a Decision Tree classifier to predict industrial machine operational states (**Failure** vs. **Production**) using sensor and maintenance data. Achieved **96% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning. 
Key predictors: `Sensor5`, `Age`, and `Sensor2`.
