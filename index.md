# 👋 Hi, I'm Lewis NDAMBIRI

Dual Master's student in **Industrial Engineering** and **Computer Science**.  
I bridge systems optimization with scalable software to solve real-world inefficiencies.

🔍 **I focus on**:  
- Process optimization & simulation  
- Data-driven decision systems  
- Automation & algorithmic efficiency  
- Human-centered system design
