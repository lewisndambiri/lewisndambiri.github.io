# My Portfolio
Hi, I'm Lewis NDAMBIRI 👋

Master's student in **Industrial Engineering** and **Computer Science**.  
I bridge systems optimization with scalable software to solve real-world inefficiencies.

🔍 **I focus on**:  
- Process optimization & simulation  
- Data-driven decision systems  
- Automation & algorithmic efficiency  
- Human-centered system design

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. Maintenance Mode Prediction
*Statistics & Data Analysis | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas*  

![Maintenance Mode Predictor preview](/projects/maintenance-mode-predictor/preview.jpg){: .project-preview }

Built a Decision Tree classifier to predict industrial machine operational states (**Failure** vs. **Production**) using sensor and maintenance data. Achieved **96% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning. 
Key predictors: `Sensor5`, `Age`, and `Sensor2`.

### 2. End-to-End Retail Analytics Engine 
*PostgreSQL, Python ETL, Advanced SQL, Power BI*  

![Retail Analytics Dashboard](/projects/retail-analytics-sql/retail_analytics.png){: .project-preview }

Designed a complete analytics pipeline - from synthetic data generation in Python to a star-schema data model in PostgreSQL, advanced SQL analysis (cohort retention, RFM segmentation, window functions), and an interactive Power BI dashboard. 
Answers key business questions: *Which products drive profit? How do customers behave? Are we hitting targets?*

### 3. Parallel Numerical Integration using Romberg’s Method
*High-Performance Computing (HPC) | C, MPI, OPENMP, PBS, Linux HPC Cluster*

![Parallel Numerical Integration](/projects/romberg-hpc4ds/hpc.jpg){: .project-preview }

Parallelized Romberg integration - a high-accuracy numerical method - using MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid MPI+OpenMP on a 6,092-core cluster using a computationally heavy integrand (sin(x)·e⁻ˣ²) with 1,000,000 artificial iterations to emulate real-world HPC workloads. Evaluated strong/weak scaling, PBS placement strategies (pack, scatter, :excl) and:
- Achieved 31.77× speedup on 32 cores with 99.3% efficiency (near-perfect scaling!)
- Analyzed 50+ benchmark configurations across multiple problem sizes
- Validated theoretical limits using Amdahl's Law (4.8% serial fraction)
