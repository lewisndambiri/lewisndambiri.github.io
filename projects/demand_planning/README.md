# Demand Forecasting

![Demand Forecasting project hero](docs/assets/images/demand-forecasting-hero-titled.png)

## Business Problem

Retail demand is uncertain, but it is not random. Store sales are shaped by recent demand, promotions, holidays, store type, assortment, competition, and calendar patterns.

The business question is:

> Can we predict daily store sales accurately enough to support planning decisions?

Better forecasts can help with:

- inventory planning
- staffing decisions
- promotion analysis
- warehouse preparation
- early detection of unusual store behavior


## Highlights

This ia an end-to-end retail demand forecasting project with XGBoost, time-aware validation, recursive future forecasts, EDA plots, Streamlit dashboard, Docker support, tests, and CI. The project uses Rossmann-style store sales data to predict daily store demand. It is structured as a small production-style machine learning project.

- XGBoost regression for tabular demand forecasting
- Time-aware holdout validation
- Leakage-conscious feature engineering
- Store-level lag and rolling sales features
- Business features for promotions, competition, and calendar behavior
- Baseline comparison against naive forecasting rules
- Recursive forecasting for unseen future rows
- EDA report with GitHub-rendered plots
- Streamlit dashboard
- Docker and deployment support
- Unit tests and GitHub Actions CI

## Dataset

The project uses the Rossmann Store Sales dataset shape:

- `train.csv`: historical store sales
- `store.csv`: store-level metadata
- `test.csv`: future rows where sales are unknown

A small synthetic sample dataset is included in `data/sample/` so the project remains runnable after cloning.

## Modeling Approach

The workflow is deliberately time-aware:

1. Load sales and store metadata.
2. Validate required columns.
3. Clean missing values and closed-store rows.
4. Build calendar and business features.
5. Build lag and rolling sales features per store.
6. Hold out the latest dates for evaluation.
7. Train XGBoost.
8. Compare against simple baselines.
9. Generate recursive forecasts for future rows.
10. Save metrics, diagnostics, and dashboard-ready artifacts.

## Why Time-Aware Validation Matters

Random train/test splits can leak future information into training. This project uses a chronological holdout:

> Train on the past, evaluate on the future.

That makes the evaluation closer to the way the model would be used in practice.

## Why Baselines Matter

A forecasting model should beat simple rules before it is considered useful.

This project compares XGBoost against:

- yesterday's sales
- same store's sales from seven days ago

XGBoost performs substantially better than both baselines.

## Results

Real Rossmann holdout results:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| RMSE | 861.246 |
| MAE | 620.781 |
| MAPE | 9.225% |
| R2 | 0.914 |

Baseline comparison:

| Method | RMSE | MAE | MAPE | R2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| XGBoost | 861.246 | 620.781 | 9.225% | 0.914 |
| Naive yesterday | 1,934.502 | 1,295.557 | 19.944% | 0.568 |
| Seasonal naive last week | 2,915.972 | 2,304.144 | 36.533% | 0.018 |

## Quick Start With Sample Data

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make train-sample
make eda-sample
make test
make dashboard
```

## Real Data Workflow

Download the Rossmann Store Sales dataset from Kaggle and place:

```text
data/train.csv
data/store.csv
data/test.csv
```

Then run:

```bash
make train
make forecast
make eda
make evaluate
make dashboard
```
## Main Outputs

Generated locally:

models/metrics.json
models/holdout_predictions.csv
models/store_metrics.csv
models/feature_importance.csv
models/future_forecast.csv

```

Model artifacts and real data stay local. Public docs and plots are safe to push.
