# My Portfolio
Hi, I'm Lewis NDAMBIRI

Dual Master's student in **Industrial Engineering** and **Computer Science**.  
I bridge systems optimization with scalable software to solve real-world inefficiencies.

🔍 **I focus on**:  
- Process optimization & simulation  
- Data-driven decision systems  
- Automation & algorithmic efficiency  
- Human-centered system design

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. Maintenance Mode Prediction
*Statistics & Data Analysis | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas*  
![Maintenance Mode Predictor preview](projects/maintenance-mode-predictor/preview.jpg){: .project-preview }
Built a Decision Tree classifier to predict industrial machine operational states (**Failure** vs. **Production**) using sensor and maintenance data. Achieved **96% accuracy** after hyperparameter tuning. 
Key predictors: `Sensor5`, `Age`, and `Sensor2`.

### 2. End-to-End Retail Analytics Engine 
*PostgreSQL, Python ETL, Advanced SQL, Power BI*  
![Retail Analytics Dashboard](projects/retail-analytics-sql/retail_analytics.png)  
Designed a complete analytics pipeline - from synthetic data generation in Python to a star-schema data model in PostgreSQL, advanced SQL analysis (cohort retention, RFM segmentation, window functions), and an interactive Power BI dashboard. 
Answers key business questions: *Which products drive profit? How do customers behave? Are we hitting targets?*
